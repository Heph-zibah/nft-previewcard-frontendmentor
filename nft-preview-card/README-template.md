## My process
for every design, I sketch it out on my notepad. this is to give me a wireframe of what i want to build

I made the HTML markup. Got the link to the google font. Then, I started styling with CSS. I got stuck with the image overlay. I went online to get direction. I later built the overlay to my satisfaction and voila! My challenge is ready.
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I learned how to make overlay. It wasnt easy at all but I checked online and i was able to pull it through.

```css
.overlay {
    position: absolute;
    top: 0;
    bottom: 0;
    left: 0;
    right: 0;
    height: 100%;
    width: 100%;
    opacity: 0;
    transition: .3s ease;
    background-color: hsl(178, 100%, 50%);
    cursor: pointer;
}
```

There is nothing like "I know it all" in coding. Every day, you keep learning. CSS Grid that I thought have mastered posed a great threat while bilding this.

also, nesting divs really gave me a run for my time.


### Continued development

CSS GRID
CSS FLEXBOX
MEDIA QUERIES


### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_image_overlay_icon.asp) - This helped me for the image overlay. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
